   China's urbanization resulted in an enormous labor transfer from the countryside to cities, which caused the appearance of the left-behind children. 
    
    
   Generally, parental labor transfer affects left-behind children's education in two ways. On the one hand, long-term separation from parents will decrease parents' care for children's education, negatively affecting students' academic performance. On the other hand, labor transfer has strengthened the ability to invest in children's education, positively impacting children's academic performance. 
    
    
   The data used in the paper come from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) in 2016 that covers about 95% of China's total population.
    
    
   The article uses four instrumental variables regressions to qualify the overall influence of parental labor transfer on children's academic grades, parents' care for children's study, and family education expenditures. The introduction of instrumental variables regressions is to reduces the impacts of endogeneity caused by omitted variables, simultaneous causality, etc. 
    
    
   The regression results show that, overall, parental labor transfer caused children's academic performance to reduce by almost 30% after considering other factors, such as parents' education level and so on. The result comes from two ways. First, parental labor transfer indeed led to parents' care for their children's studies by almost 0.28 points (the top grade is 5), which negatively affects children's academic performance. Besides, the paper also qualifies the effect of parents' decreasing care for children's learning: for each unit decrease in care for students' studies, children would get 0.6 points in their examination less. It is the major adverse impact of parental labor transfer. 
    
    
   On the other hand, parental labor transfer can increase family income, thus increase education investments in theory. It is true that working in cities help increase education expenditures. According to regression results, left-behind children's families would spend almost 740 Chinese yuan more than non-left-behind children's families on children's education. However, increasing education investments did not work well. The article finds that every 1,000 Chinese yuan increase in children's education can only improve children's grades by 0.005. Namely, rising education expenditures have nearly no effect on their studies.
    
    
   In the future, while increasing investment in education for left-behind children, the government should also help provide more educational resources to improve the efficiency of education investments. According to the quantitative analysis of this article, the efficiency of family education investments for left-behind children is very low, which may be related to the lack of educational resources and services in rural services, the low-quality teaching materials, etc. The government should also ensure that migrant workers have the right to take vacations to have more time to stay with their children, which is meaningful for improving children's performance. Other subsidies for migrant workers are also worth trying, such as subsidizing their transportation expenses back home, etc.
